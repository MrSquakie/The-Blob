# Change Log
All notable changes to “Obi - Advanced softbodies for Unity” will be documented in this file.


## [4.1]

### Added
- Bake Mesh functionality that allows to generate a mesh asset from a deformed softbody.
- More accurate collision/contact model, using staggered projections.
- Approximate shock propagation for particle contacts. This makes particle stacking easier and stabler. A new parameter has been added to the solver that controls the amount of shock propagation.
- Split material friction into static and dynamic friction.
- Added rolling contacts w/ rolling friction. These are slightly more expensive than regular contacts. Can be controlled on a per-collision material basis.
- Added ObiInstancedParticleRenderer, allows to draw particles as instances of an arbitrary mesh (requires GPU instancing).
- Particle-particle collision callbacks (solver.OnParticleCollision)

### Changed
- Moved softbody skinning to its own component, ObiSoftbodySkinner. This allows multiple meshes to be skinned to the same softbody particles.
- More reliable, higher precision algorithm for distance field generation. Specially noticeable in sharp corners/crevices.

### Fixed
- Bug that caused spurious torque when initializing a softbody at non-zero rotation.
- Bug that caused mesh colliders with negative thickness to crash.

## [4.0.2]

### Changed
- Switched the Windows compiler to Clang/LLVM, resulting in a huge performance improvement.

### Fixed
- Null ref exception when copying a ObiCloth component.
- Issue with pin constraints overshooting when solver set to world space mode.
- Issue that prevented pin constraints being torn.

## [4.0.0] - 2018-12-2
- Initial release.
